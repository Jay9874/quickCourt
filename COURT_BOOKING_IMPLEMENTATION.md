# Court Booking Page Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive court booking system for the QUICKCOURT application based on the provided mockup. The implementation includes:

1. **Court Booking Page** (`/booking/:venueId`)
2. **My Bookings Page** (`/profile/bookings`)
3. **Updated routing and navigation**

## Features Implemented

### Court Booking Page (`/pages/CourtBooking.jsx`)
- **Sport Selection**: Dropdown for selecting the sport type
- **Date Selection**: Interactive calendar popup with date validation
- **Time Slot Selection**: Time slot picker with availability status
- **Duration Selection**: Adjustable duration with +/- buttons (1-4 hours)
- **Court Selection**: Multiple court selection with visual tags
- **Price Calculation**: Real-time price calculation based on duration and courts
- **Payment Flow**: Simulated payment processing with redirect to My Bookings

### Key Components
- **Calendar Popup**: Shows available dates (past dates disabled)
- **Time Slots Popup**: Displays available time slots with disabled unavailable ones
- **Court Tags**: Visual representation of selected courts with remove functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with proper popup positioning

### My Bookings Page (`/pages/MyBookings.jsx`)
- **Booking History**: Displays all user bookings
- **Status Management**: Shows booking status (confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- **Action Buttons**: Cancel, rate, and view details for each booking
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no bookings exist

## File Structure

└── components/
    └── BookVenue.jsx             # Existing component (kept for reference)
```

## Routing

- **`/booking/:venueId`** - Court booking page for specific venue
- **`/profile/bookings`** - My bookings page
- **`/venues/:id`** - Venue detail page (updated with booking button)

## User Flow

1. User visits venue detail page
2. Clicks "Book this venue" button
3. Redirected to court booking page
4. Selects sport, date, time, duration, and courts
5. Views total price calculation
6. Clicks "Continue to Payment"
7. Simulated payment processing
8. Redirected to My Bookings page

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React hooks for form state management
- Local state for UI interactions (popups, selections)
- Mock data for venue information and time slots

### Validation
- Date validation (must be today or later)
- Time slot availability checking
- Court selection validation
- Form completion validation

### Styling
- Dark theme matching the mockup
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Interactive elements with hover states
- Proper z-index management for popups

## Mock Data

The implementation uses mock data for:
- Venue information (SBR Badminton)
- Available courts (Table 1-4)
- Time slots (7 AM - 10 PM)
- Pricing (₹600 per hour per court)

## Future Enhancements

1. **API Integration**: Replace mock data with real API calls
2. **Real-time Availability**: Check court availability in real-time
3. **Payment Gateway**: Integrate actual payment processing
4. **Booking Management**: Add booking modification and cancellation
5. **Notifications**: Email/SMS confirmations
6. **Calendar Sync**: Add to calendar functionality

## Usage

### Starting the Development Server
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Accessing the Pages
- Visit any venue detail page (e.g., `/venues/1`)
- Click "Book this venue" button
- Navigate to court booking page
- Complete the booking form
- View bookings at `/profile/bookings`

## Dependencies

All required dependencies are already installed:
- `react-icons` - For icons
- `react-router-dom` - For routing
- `zustand` - For state management (if needed for global state)

## Notes

- The implementation follows the exact design from the mockup
- All interactive elements are fully functional
- The booking flow simulates a real-world scenario
- The design is responsive and accessible
- Error handling and validation are implemented
- The code follows React best practices

## Testing

1. Navigate to a venue detail page
2. Test the booking flow
3. Verify form validation
4. Check responsive design on mobile
5. Test the My Bookings page
6. Verify navigation between pages
